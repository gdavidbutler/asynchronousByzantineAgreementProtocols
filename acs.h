/*
 * Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS)
 *
 * Composition of Bracha's reliable broadcast (Figure 1) and binary
 * consensus (Figure 4) into multi-value agreement on a common subset.
 *
 * Construction (BKR 1994, Miller et al. 2016 "HoneyBadger"):
 *   Each of N peers proposes a value (arbitrary bytes, up to vLen+1).
 *   N reliable broadcasts (Fig1) distribute proposals.
 *   N binary consensuses (Fig4) decide inclusion.
 *
 *   When Fig1 for origin j reaches ACCEPT: vote 1 in BA_j.
 *   When n-t Fig1 broadcasts accepted: vote 0 in all remaining BAs.
 *   Common subset = { j : BA_j decided 1 }.
 *   Subset contains at least n-t origins.
 *
 * Pure state machine: no I/O, no threads, no dynamic allocation.
 * Caller provides memory and delivers messages.
 *
 * Two message classes on the network:
 *   ACS_CLS_PROPOSAL  — Fig1 messages carrying proposal values
 *   ACS_CLS_CONSENSUS — Fig1 messages for per-origin binary consensus
 *
 * Operational limits:
 *   n:         unsigned char, encodes process count 1..256 (n + 1)
 *   t:         unsigned char, max 85 (n + 1 > 3t required)
 *   vLen:      unsigned char, encodes proposal length 1..256 (vLen + 1)
 *   maxPhases: unsigned char, for binary consensus (per BKR instance)
