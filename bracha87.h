 * Gabriel Bracha - Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement Protocols
 *
 * Four composable pure state machines, one per figure.
 * No I/O, no threads, no dynamic allocation.
 * Caller provides memory and executes output actions.
 *
 * Composition:
 *   message -> Fig1(n,t) -> accept -> Fig2/3(N) -> round complete -> Fig4(coin) -> decision
 *
 * Fig 2 defines the abstract protocol round (send, receive n-t, v := N(k,S)).
 * Fig 3 refines Fig 2: replaces receive with validate (VALID sets).
 *
 * Each module boundary matches the paper exactly.
 * Proofs apply per-module: Lemmas 1-4 and Theorem 1 to Fig1,
 * Lemmas 5-7 to Fig2/3, Lemmas 8-10 and Theorems 2-3 to Fig4.
 *
 * Operational limits:
 *   n:         unsigned char, encodes process count 1..256 (n + 1)
 *   t:         unsigned char, max 85 (n + 1 > 3t required)
 *   vLen:      unsigned char, encodes value length 1..256 (vLen + 1 bytes)
 *   maxPhases: unsigned char, max BRACHA87_MAX_PHASES (85)
 *   rounds:    unsigned char, 0-based, max 3 * BRACHA87_MAX_PHASES - 1 (254)

 * End-to-end argument applied to Bracha (Saltzer/Reed/Clark

 *
 * Retry the broadcast actions this instance is still owed under
 * fair-loss -- offered to recover eventual delivery without an
 * application-layer retry bookkeeping.  Returns the number of actions (0..3) to broadcast.
 *
 * Reactive: rules fire only when called.  No wall-clock predicate
 * appears anywhere; the application's retry tick IS the event, so
 * asynchrony is preserved.  The rate of retry calls bounds retry
 * volume.
 *
 * Minimal retry -- each action retires at the soonest point
 * it is provably no longer owed to ANY correct process:
 *   INITIAL (initiator only): retires at ACCEPTED, or once an echo has
 *     been observed from every process (echoSenders == n).  INITIAL
 *     only induces echoes, so all-echoed leaves nothing to induce;
 *     ACCEPTED witnesses t+1 correct readys, after which ready-
 *     amplification needs no initial.
 *   ECHO (echoed): retires at ACCEPTED, for the same amplification
 *     reason -- past t+1 correct readys no process consumes an echo.
 *   READY (rdSent): never retires on LOCAL state.  It is exactly
 *     what the amplification tail consumes; an accepted process still
 *     owes its (ready, v) to processes below 2t+1, and retry is the
 *     only delivery mechanism under loss.  It DOES retire on the
 *     REMOTE fact that every process has accepted (acFrom count == n),
 *     after which no process consumes a ready anywhere -- genuine
 *     quiescence, where the application's termination policy would
 *     otherwise carry the never-retired tail.  Below that, the
 *     per-process suppress mask (bracha87Fig1Skip) still drops READY to
 *     the processes already known accepted.
 *
 *     The all-n quiescence is best-effort under loss, NOT a guaranteed
 *     terminal state: once a process's own acFrom reaches n it stops
 *     retrying READY -- and with it the ACCEPTED annotation -- so a
 *     process that lost those final announcements may never set the last
 *     acFrom bit and never quiesces.  This is safe: it can only happen
 *     once every process has accepted, i.e. consensus is already complete,
 *     and the un-quiesced process merely keeps retrying a READY no correct
 *     process consumes.  The application's abandonment policy is the real
 *     backstop; acFrom == n is an optimisation that collapses the tail
 *     when the announcements arrive, not a liveness guarantee.
 *
 * Per-process suppression: every retry action carries a suppress mask
 * (bracha87Fig1Skip; on the array path, struct bracha87Fig1Act.skip)
 * naming processes that provably no longer consume it -- echoed processes for
 * INITIAL, readied processes for ECHO, accepted processes for READY.  The
 * caller's broadcast skips them.  This is the individual-process refinement
 * of the all-or-nothing retires above: a fast process is dropped from the
 * recipient set the moment IT crosses, not when the last process does.
 * INITIAL and ECHO are bootstrap-only; ACCEPTED is the local
 * witness (>= t+1 of 2t+1 readys are correct) that the bootstrap
 * is complete.  These stops are strictly stronger than the
 * "stop once locally echoed/accepted-so-stop-ready" gates that
 * would strand slow processes -- those remain forbidden.
 *
 * Returns 0 when there is nothing sent to retry (a non-initiator
 * instance that has not echoed -- the natural "idle" signal at the
 * Fig1 level), or when every sent action has hit its retire
 * gate above: INITIAL and ECHO at ACCEPTED (INITIAL also at
 * all-echoed), READY at all-n-accepted.  An RDSENT instance
 * therefore outputs at least READY until the all-n-accepted gate
 * closes; past that it is quiescent and returns 0.
 *
 * Out actions reuse BRACHA87_INITIAL_ALL / BRACHA87_ECHO_ALL /
 * BRACHA87_READY_ALL; the echoed value is read via
 * bracha87Fig1Value, same as after Input.  Order of actions in

 *
 * On BRACHA87_BROADCAST: caller reads fig4->value for the broadcast value
 *   and fig4->phase/fig4->subRound for the round number.
 * On BRACHA87_DECIDE: caller reads fig4->decision.
 * On BRACHA87_EXHAUSTED: all phases consumed without decision -- the
 *   machine can issue no new phase/round, so it will never decide.
 *   See the success-vs-stop note below.
 *
 * BRACHA87_DECIDE is returned exactly once (the first time >2t d-messages
 * are seen), combined with BRACHA87_BROADCAST. Per the paper, a decided
 * process continues participating so others can reach consensus.
 *
 * DECIDE is a success signal, NOT a stop condition.  A decided
 * process keeps broadcasting (post-decide continuation, above), so
 * the caller must never treat DECIDE as "done, stop."  The same
 * holds for Fig 1's BRACHA87_ACCEPT — reliable broadcast has no stop
 * condition at all (no EXHAUSTED, no phase ceiling).  Under unbounded
 * latency no process can know that stopping is safe, so when to stop
 * after a decision is an application policy, not a library event.
 * BRACHA87_EXHAUSTED is not a stop either: it reports that no new
 * phase/round can be issued (surfaced upward as
 * BKR94ACS_ACT_BA_EXHAUSTED); the application factors that into the
 * same abandonment policy.
 *
 * BRACHA87_EXHAUSTED is also returned at most once: it is mutually
 * exclusive with BRACHA87_DECIDE (decideV requires !haveDecided;
 * EXHAUSTED requires sub=2 of the last phase with !haveDecided &&
 * !decideV) and the maxPhases ceiling makes single output structural.
 * Subsequent calls to bracha87Fig4Round on an EXHAUSTED instance are
 * safe and return 0 actions; the state machine remains in EXHAUSTED.
 * No unilateral substitute decision is produced -- exhaustion means
 * no new phase/round can be issued; the application folds that into
 * its abandonment policy.
 *
 * Inbound message integrity is the caller's responsibility (sender
 * authentication, well-formed framing).  Within those bounds, malformed
 * Byzantine values are filtered structurally: fig3IsValid via fig4Nfn
 * rejects any value outside {0, 1, D_FLAG|0, D_FLAG|1} appropriate for
 * the round, so they are non-events that do not advance phase.  An
 * adversarial schedule can still prevent a local decision by
 * preventing n-t honest validations -- this is the asynchronous
 * impossibility result, not a defect.
 *
 * The round k maps to phase/subRound:
 *   phase = k / 3
 *   subRound = k % 3
 *
 * This function is called when Fig3 reports n-t validated messages
 * for round k. The caller passes the validated set.
