/*
 * BKR94 Asynchronous Common Subset
 *
 * Direct implementation of Ben-Or/Kelmer/Rabin 1994, "Asynchronous
 * Secure Computations with Optimal Resilience (Extended Abstract),"
 * PODC '94, pages 183-192, Section 4 Figure 3 (Protocol
 * Agreement[Q]).  See BKR94ACS.txt for the line-by-line paper
 * extract this header and its companion .c file are aligned to.
 *
 * Composes Bracha87 Figure 1 (reliable broadcast) with Bracha87
 * Figure 4 (binary consensus) into multi-value agreement on a common
 * subset.  N reliable broadcasts distribute proposals; N binary
 * consensuses decide inclusion.
 *
 * BKR94 parameterizes the protocol by a predicate Q(j).  Under the
 * two paper assumptions — (1) Q eventually equals 1 for every honest
 * player, (2) every honest player eventually learns Q(j) for every j
 * — Protocol Agreement[Q] produces a common subset of size >= n-t of
 * players for whom Q(j) = 1.
 *
 *   This deployment: Q(j) = "Fig1 reliable broadcast for origin j
 *   has ACCEPTED" (the BKR94 MPC-construction equivalent is "P_j has
 *   properly shared his input").  Reliable broadcast gives both Q
 *   assumptions for free: Bracha87 Fig1 eventually accepts every
 *   honest broadcast at every honest receiver (Lemma 4).
 *
 * The three Figure 3 steps, per player P_i:
 *
 *   Step 1. For each j where you know Q(j)=1, vote 1 in BA_j.
 *   Step 2. When 2t+1 BAs have terminated with output 1, vote 0 in
 *           every BA where you have not yet entered a value.
 *   Step 3. Once all N BAs terminate, SubSet = { j : BA_j = 1 }.
 *
 * The "2t+1" in Step 2 is n-t in the paper's regime (n = 3t+1) and
 * is the implementation threshold for all supported (n, t).
 *
 * Pure state machine: no I/O, no threads, no dynamic allocation.
 * Caller provides memory and delivers messages.
 *
 * Two message classes on the network:
 *   BKR94ACS_CLS_PROPOSAL  — Fig1 messages carrying proposal values
 *   BKR94ACS_CLS_CONSENSUS — Fig1 messages for per-origin binary consensus
 *
 * Operational limits:
 *   n:         unsigned char, encodes process count 1..256 (n + 1)
 *   t:         unsigned char, max 85 (n + 1 > 3t required)
 *   vLen:      unsigned char, encodes proposal length 1..256 (vLen + 1)
 *   maxPhases: unsigned char, for binary consensus (per BKR94 BA instance)
